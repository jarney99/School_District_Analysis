# School District Analysis
## Overview 
We are helping Maria analyze data on student funding and student standardized test scores. We analyzed their performance on math and reading standardized tests to help the school board decide where they should allocate their funding. 
### Purpose
The school board is trying to decide where to allocate their funds, so we analyzed the students standardized test scores. However, there was evidence of acadmenic dishonesty specifically from Thomas High School. We went back over the code and re wrote it to make the math and reading scores for the ninth graders NaNs while still keeping the data from tenth, eleventh, and twelfth the same.

  * We can see by looking at the district summary that there were a few changes one the ninth graders from Thomas High School were taken out. The averge math score     went from 79 to 78.9, the average reading score didn't change, % passing math went from 75 to 74.8, % passing reading went from 86 to 85.7, and % overall           passing   went from 65 to 64.9.

  * The school summary was affected by average math going from 83.42 to 83.35, average reading going from 83.85 to 83.9, % passing math went from 93.3 to 66.91, %      passign reading went from 97.3 to 69.66, and the % overall passed went from 90.95 to 65.08.
  
  * Replacing the ninth grade scores caused Thomas High School to drop out of the top 10.
   
  * Replacing the ninth grade scores also causes the math and reading score grades to decrease
   
  * Thomas high school is a medium size school
  
  * For a charter, average math declined from 83.47 to 83.46, average reading went from 83.89 to 83.9, % passing math went from 93.6 to 90.3, % passing readind went     from 96.6 to 93.1, and % overall passing went from 90.4 to 87.2.
