# School District Analysis
## Overview 
We are helping Maria analyze data on student funding and student standardized test scores. We analyzed their performance on math and reading standardized tests to help the school board decide where they should allocate their funding. 
### Purpose
The school board is trying to decide where to allocate their funds, so we analyzed the students standardized test scores. However, there was evidence of acadmenic dishonesty specifically from Thomas High School. We went back over the code and re wrote it to make the math and reading scores for the ninth graders NaNs while still keeping the data from tenth, eleventh, and twelfth the same. 
## Results

We can see by looking at the district summary that there were a few changes one the ninth graders from Thomas High School were taken out. The averge math score went from 79 to 78.9, the average reading score didn't change, % passing math went from 75 to 74.8, % passing reading went from 86 to 85.7, and % overall passing went from 65 to 64.9.
